v1.0.0 (rev A)	06/18/2008	WJT
-----------------------------------

- Initial version

- Replaces:
	SWP-700010049 rev A     Linux Software (SDM7540)
	SWP-700010005 rev C	Linux Software (DM7520)


v2.0.0 (rev B) 6/1/2015        RGG
-----------------------------------
- Numerous minor bug fixes.
- Removed all kernel 2.4 support.  The driver now only supports Linux kernels 
  2.6.0 and later.  It also supports kernel 3.0+ (up to 3.8.8 tested)
- Added support for 64-bit Linux OS.
- Interrupts in the driver are now handled via a queue.
- Added flush to example program etrig_intrpt so that test procedure could
  be followed.
- Removed /proc system, as it had changed in kernel 3.10, and was only being
  kept around to help the Makefile create the correct number of device files.
  Instead, now the driver itself will make the device files when the module
  is inserted.

  
v3.0.0 (rev C) 5/1/2016        RGG
-----------------------------------
- Fixed a bug in the driver that caused random crashes in 64-bit distros.
- Removed ISR prioritizing call as it does not actually do anything.
- Added a small sleep to any interrupt polling loop, to give a chance for
  the user-side ISR to execute.
- Renamed DM75xx_Return_Status to DM7xx_Exit_On_Error as it is more descriptive
  of what it actually does.
