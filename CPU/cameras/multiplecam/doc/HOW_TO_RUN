In order to start acquiring images, 
you must run the script multiplecam.sh

USAGE: ./multiplecam.sh SOFTWAREPATH IMAGESAVINGPATH NIR_ON_OFF VIS_ON_OFF
  
NIR_ON_OFF and VIS_ON_OFF possible values are 0 and 1; 1 is ON and 0 is OFF.

This means to start acquisition with both cameras and save e.g. to usb disk, 
you have to run:
 
./multiplecam.sh /home/software/cameras/multiplecam/ /media/usb0/ 1 1

If you want to start acquisition with NIR camera only and save to usb disk, 
you have to run instead: 

./multiplecam.sh /home/software/cameras/multiplecam/ /media/usb0/ 1 0

If you want to start acquisition with VIS camera only and save to usb disk, 
you have to run instead: 

./multiplecam.sh /home/software/cameras/multiplecam/ /media/usb0/ 0 1

NOTE: multiplecam.sh contains several check on input parameters. 
For example, it will abort and exit if you do not give all the input parameters or 
if you try to put both cameras to OFF or if you use a value different from 0 or 1 for the 
NIR_ON_OFF and VIS_ON_OFF parameters.
However, keep in mind that no check is performed on the input paths, so you should know
a priori if they can be accessed and if you have read/write permissions to them. 



*** SPECIAL CASE *** 

In case you need to launch from prompt only one of the available executables,
proceed as follows.

1) HOW TO USE listserials:
 
./listserials PARFILEDIRECTORY

e.g. ./listserials  /home/software/cameras/multiplecam/parfiles/

2) HOW TO USE multiplecam:

./multiplecam  PARFILEDIRECTORY CURRENT_NIR_PARFILE_STATUS CURRENT_VIS_PARFILE_STATUS IMAGESAVINGPATH

e.g. ./multiplecam /home/software/cameras/multiplecam/parfiles/ N Y /media/usb0/ 

3) HOW TO USE singlecam:

./singlecam  PARFILEDIRECTORY CURRENT_PARFILE_STATUS IMAGESAVINGPATH CAMERASERIALNUMBER

e.g. ./singlecam /home/software/cameras/multiplecam/parfiles/ N Y /media/usb0/ 15568736
