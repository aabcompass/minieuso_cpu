A script install.sh is located in the src folder, please run it as:

./install.sh SOFTWAREPATH

e.g. ./install.sh home/software/cameras/multiplecam

This command compiles all the source files and then launched the listserials
executable to create the cameras.ini file under the parfiles folder
CAVEAT: note that if no camera is connected the cameras.ini file 
cannot be created and you will be warned about with a screen message.
NOTE that cameras.ini file is needed by multiplecam.sh when 
launching acquisition using only one camera.
