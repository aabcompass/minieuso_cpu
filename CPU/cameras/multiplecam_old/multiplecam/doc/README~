What it is new in 2.4 version:

- Implemented the possibility to set the frame rate off or on in the parameter file. Note that this 
on/off check is made case insensitive. If frame rate is set off, the shutter time is the only value 
used to regulate camera's exposure. If it set on, frame rate and shutter are both used to to regulate 
camera's exposure. Note that if the frame rate is set on and its value in the parfile is 
outside the allowed range, the program is aborted. Note that if the shutter time value in the parfile
is outside the allowed range, the shutter time is set by default to the maximum allowed value. 

What it is new in 2.3 version:

- Implemented the possibility to set a value for the GAIN parameter as the autoexposure is set off.

What it is new in 2.2 version:

- Each camera has its one parfile, so parameters can be set totally independently for the two cameras.
