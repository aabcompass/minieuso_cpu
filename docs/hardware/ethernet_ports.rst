Ethernet ports
==============

The CPU system has two ethernet ports: 

1. eth0 - external internet or ssh connection - CN30
2. eth1 - static IP connection to the Zynq board - CN20

The location of these two ports is shown in here:

**NB: this is true for the CMX34GS model (original CPU), for the CMX34BTS model (new CPU) the ethernet ports are switched.**
